We aren't going to see widespread adoption until there is more regulation in place and a safer playground for more risk averse people and institutions to live within. This can live in harmony with crypto as it is today. This of course does assume that the regulations are done intelligently, which is definitely not a given. But I do think it has a solid chance of happening. There's enough money in crypto with folks like the Winklevii and Armstrong that will push the regulation in the right direction.

CON-ARGUMENTS
I'm totally aware that this will be probably the most downvoted post in the history of this sub. But I don't care.

Algo is the most shilled coin on reddit. I am the unlucky one and took the bait and bought Algo because of the shill. I did the research and on paper everything looked great. Fast, secure, reliable. I have read a lot of articles, read whitepaper and bought Algo. But now after half a year of holding I have to say that it's really bad. And I'll tell you why. Keep in mind that I'm talking about the WHOLE ALGO ECOSYSTEM and not blockchain itself.

Dapps - like currently there are 5 or 6 daapps? This is a joke. Younger chains have hundreds of them but in algo ecosystem there are 5 or 6 dapps and they are working really bad (more about this in the next points. The chain being young is not an excuse because other chains have much more cool and usefull daaps. Algo dapps are using AVM (Algorand wirtual machine) so the adoption will be always slower and slower.

Dapps working like shit. Many of those daaps rely on a single source of truth that is Algoexplorer API. It has constant problems and because of that platforms like yieldly works like shit. November and December was horrible. There wasn't a single day without any issues.

Official wallet... Sometimes is not working. Or not working correctly. It's too dependant on Algoexporer api and AWS.

ALGO is CENTRALIZED

No rewards for running own node

Yesterday the only Algorand DEX tinyman was compromised and hacked and all liquidity pools are gone.

Horrible marketing.

No clear roadmap for 2022.

Unfulfilled promises (example? about increasing TPS)

A lot small ones like poor website (doesn't look professional) and poor communication with Algorand Foundation

The Algorand community on reddit is so toxic and blind. If the Algo price is increasing they are posting charts and yelling how awesome Algo is and the pump is incoming. When it's down they claim that it's just because of bitcoin? You get it? Algo UP - it's because algo is awesome? Algo down - because of bitcoin. They hate every other chain because only ALGORAND is the best.

Poor price action comparing to other scalable solutions.

Ok some of you may disagree with some points but most of them are straigth facts. Please research about the recent Hack and algoexplorer problems.

Edit: Thanks for all rewards!"

You will learn the patterns and odds are btc will cross 100k in the next bull run following the 2024 halving. If you can stack 1-2 btc your looking at 100-200k off of investing 10-40k depending on what Bitcoin prices are in the current bear market. We might see sub 20k prices soon.
Negative,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/u6v14o/every_single_crypto_product_is_a_scam_every/,"Seriously, I feel like I'm taking crazy pills here but how is this not apparent to everyone? And before crypto-bros come out of the woodwork and say that I don't understand crypto, I read the original whitepaper maybe a year or so after it came out and have kept reasonably well informed on crypto stuff since then.

Early days bitcoin was kind of interesting but it pretty quickly became apparent that it could never function as a consumer currency. If Bitcoin attempted to process even 1% of the transactions that AMEX does in a day it would take weeks to verify a transaction. So if it can't be used a a currency WTF is it? People started pointing out that gold is largely worthless except as an agreed store of value so they said 'well can't Bitcoin be that?' No, of course it can't. Gold has physical substance and the backing of nation states, it's value is protected by legal and social institutions. Yeah, all money is fake but Bitcoin is the fakest of all.

At the end of the day all crypto is worthless until you can find someone to trade you actual fiat currency for it, because it can't be used to fucking buy anything! That means that all crypto is just a 'bagholder' scam it works as long as the next idiot comes along to hold the bag. Fundamentally, it is no different from the holofoil comic book covers that almost destroyed the comics industry in the speculative bubble of the 90's, except there's a level of exposure the size of a small western European country.

PERSPECTIVE
Banks suck but crypto aint much better. Higly speculative and unstable. Just as much bullshit as there is on wallstreet. Leverage, shorting, futures, longs, market manipulation and what not. People gambling with their money.

Your keys arn't really safe, what do you want to do, implement a chip in your arm? What if the chip breaks? Keep it digitally somewhere? Dig a hole in the ground? Most people keep it on centralised exchanges anyway. What if you die, it won't go to your relatives?

It fucks with your mental and emotional state too, because of the unstable nature of it. One day you think you have money, the next day 20% is gone. People who buy early are basicly just taking other peoples investment when they sell. Call it pyramid games. The space is flooding with scammers, annoying shilling shouting idiots and and what not.

Bitcoin and the likes are highly energy inefficient. Yes but look at the regular financial systems energy use you will say, blah blah....this is like saying u can dump your plastic in the river because there's a plastic soup already in the ocean. Yes here and there they use solar panels...well why not use them for more usefull things as they are costly to make. Yes but proof of stake you will say, yes...it's basicly being kept in the air by people that are again....gambling with their money. All these company's, can't they just build stuff without thousands of people throwing their money at them, hoping they will get rich temselves.

Blockchains are cool in their decentralised way, but all the speculation on top of it...

While everyone is shouting at digital coins, society remains a shithole. Salaries are low for most people, housing prices are still going through the roof. Crypto won't safe us. Wealthy people will get more wealthy at the cost of others, and some might get lucky..the lucky few who are in it early and take other peoples money when they finally cash out.

Sorry for the rant, but this is kind of how I'm starting to feel about the whole thing."

Positive,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ux8xfw/if_demand_for_bitcoin_goes_up/,"Bitcoin is many things. It's compared more to the function of gold in relation to gold being the foundation and beginning of Fiat.

Fiat was created because it was easier to transact with than literally gold. Gold became a denominator of the value of fiat. The problem is that through corruption and human error there is no longer any way to verify the supply of fiat and gold (printing fiat and mixing gold with other things and bad bookkeeping)

Then there's Bitcoin. Imagine the same story but instead of gold, fiat being backed by BTC. A verifiable, limited, infinitely divisible asset that is mined through proof of work (like gold)

Bitcoin is also easier to transact with directly compared to literal gold. This is why people consider it as a possible currency.

If the gold/fiat supply was trusted, then you also wouldn't transact with your precious gold. That's what fiat is for. Same with BTC. Hold BTC, spend fiat.

Truth is Bitcoin is many things. Store of value, digital energy (because unusable electricity can be used to mine Bitcoin) transactable medium (currency), a collectible (because it's limited and supply gets lower everytime somebody loses their BTC wallet keys)

BTC beats gold. BTC beats fiat. Its more scarce than gold, easy to transfer across the world, non-corruptible, decentralized, verifiable.

It's an alternative to our current Fiat/gold standard, and the only missing component is adoption."

I had nothing against Dogecoin. To be honest, I liked it because it was the most popular meme coin these last years and the community seemed really cool - until Elon Musk started to talk about it (at least, that's why I think it became so annoying).

EVERY POST involving crypto (in some cases not even involving it), especially posts by Elon Musk, there are these people spamming dumb shit about this doggy coin.

One of the most famous figures I've noticed is Matt Wallece. Just take a look at his tweets history and you will understand what I'm saying - and he is just one of them.

I'm annoyed of Dogecoin because of these people. How can your life be resumed by convincing people all the time that there's a crypto out there that is worth paying for?

Edit: Yeah, hate is a strong word. I don't hate it, but I'm sick of reading Dogecoin everywhere.

Whatever blockchain you identify as ""best tech"" can just be literally copied or forked, and the new chain with 0 track record is equally technically good.

Having said that, best for what? There are different blockchains that have some feature that distinguishes them from the rest, and if that feature is the standard, they'd be the best. Should everybody abandon whatever the top blockchain is every time a new project comes out that is ""better""?

ETH is good. It was the first to do what it does, has a large number of qualified developers, and lots of nodes. As you say, cheaper, faster, etc. blockchains are now out there--but what's that to all the dApps built on ETH? There's a lot of inertia and human effort tied up in ETH smart contracts. And what if another new generation comes out next year even faster, smarter, cheaper, etc? Or should we go with L2s? Or chains cross-compatible with other chains? Or focus on bridges?

In the end, ETHs value has a lot to do with being first. It has a track record. Millions have found it reliable. Hackers have had at it. Legal jurisdictions have tolerated it. Any clone has a lesser track record. People are more inclined to trust such a blockchain than something shiny and new where they'd have to research the premine and inflation and developers and see if there are any new vulnerabilities that snuck into the code.

Bitcoin for money and Ethereum for computing do pretty good against the basic requirements for money or computing. People like using what everybody uses. Other chains may end up displacing BTC and ETH, but thousands have tried and failed--it won't be simply because something with better tech, speed, etc. came along."

And all this money is coming out of the same bucket because crypto isn't a closed loop, meaning you don't get paid in crypto and transact in crypto directly, you have to buy it with fiat and when you buy something with it the vendor then has to exchange it back to fiat for it to have any real use for them because its not a medium of exchange excepton the very razors edge of the margin....

As the economy gets worse and prices keep going up people simply have less money, so you are going to have a lot more sellers than buyers willing to put their fiat into the riskiest of assets when they have to pay 50% more for food and gas and might lose their job soon.

POLITICS
I used to think that Bitcoin Cash was a traitor and to be avoided at all costs. I thought, how can anyone trust an ecosystem if Bitcoin, the #1 coin that everyone holds and believes in ends up being dethroned? Why would anyone invest in this space if King BTC is no more? These were my thoughts in 2017 up until just the other day...



Now, I have come to terms that BCH is not just a copy and paste clone of Bitcoin. Every single Bitcoin holder on the planet received an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash because it was a forked from Bitcoin. This means that even if Bitcoin Cash became the #1 cryptocurrency, that Bitcoin holders have no one to blame but themselves if they don't own an equal portion of Bitcoin Cash... it was given to them for free! I guess the more and more I have thought about it, Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin because it has the same previous transaction history and literally everyone holding Bitcoin received an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash, this was no money grab.

Bitcoin may or may not scale with its small blocksize. We should be thanking Bitcoin Cash for being created to give a counter argument to see if increasing the blocksize ends up being good for scalability and fees. And if it ends up being the #1 cryptocurrency because of this, who cares, everyone holding Bitcoin during the time of the fork holds an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash, and if they don't, then that is on them.

DISCUSSION
According to Coin Market cap there are 16,844 cryptos out on the world market although Coin Gecko shows 12,463. Still, that's a shitload. No wonder some of my non crypto friends think crypto is simply a penny stock market. Those of us in the space know some project have very good intentions and fail. Some succeed. Some just hang out. But so many others are pure scam and we all know it. I guess that is the price of decentralization and I sometimes struggle with this. We don't believe in censorship so why would we be in the business of telling new projects they aren't allowed because we are already too many in the room.

Sadly too many people will invest their life in dumb things like squid game tokens only to find no liquidity when trying to cash out. Others will simply be rug pulled. The worse part is the hit we as investors and believers of fundamentals take as it creates a bad reputation and gives crypto a terrible image. If politicians and regulators should have a beef with anything about crypto its these shady scam projects but how to determine a shady scam project until it is officially a scam. Many people in the crypto world still say Shib for example is a scam and that's their opinion. Many people not in crypto say Bitcoin is a scam. Many bitcoiners say ethereum is a scam and so on. So where do we go from here? One critique politicians often use is crypto can't police itself when it comes to these scams and rug pulls so they need harsh and strict regulation to be enforced and penalized. How can crypto police itself when project tribes can't stand each other and all they do is throw each other trash on twitter.

My hope is that in time as more and more people come in there are better educational tools for noobs to be aware of what is a fire hazard but I am not optimistic. People will do what they want to do in hopes of hitting a moon shot and some shady scammers know this so I imagine that number I typed in the title will likely reach 20,000 or 25,0000 by the time 2022 is over."

Positive,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/us70jy/for_a_a_whole_year_now_cryptobitcoin_lost_people/,"Bitcoin is a great hedge against inflation because demand is growing, fiat keeps printing, yet there are fewer BTC put into existence each year as it trends toward 0.

If you buy 1BTC now for $30K and held for ten years - 1BTC be a lot more scarce and $30k will be worth a lot less. The same way the stock market or any asset can be a hedge against inflation. It usually counts on you selling as inflation happens not during the fallout after - crypto preformed extremely well in the last two years during the run up of the (lagging) CPI.

Ethereum is a hedge against inflation because people spend $20-80 million for its blockspace each DAY. It mints $30M in new coins which get sold each day to people who want blockspace. Next year it will mint $3M new coins each day forever after, and I'm taking the bet people will pay even more for blockspace in the future (by L2 compression protocols that batch 1000s into 1). Blockspace is finate and demand is strong, it's been a good bet to make so far.

Here's a great site to compare POW and POS Ethereum. Something like a 2000x energy reduction sometime this year.

Bitcoin mining is done on specialized hardware so the economics of that are a lot different than GPU mining, and very strongly incentivize the new development of clean power. IMO large corporations having access to ~$0 energy while selling it for a cost isn't sustainable for true decentralization but whatever, it keeps coal mines from being profitable too if the hashrate can be inexpensively high.
The argument against it usually is that it allows existing mines to stay open longer by recycling their otherwise wasted energy into BTC which means they may not go bankrupt. That's still a step in the right direction compared to flaring it all into the sky though, and that BTC can be sent somewhere that has no power to create power (like oil is used).

Every 4 years the amount of new BTC minted per block is reduced by half, and the hashrate (security/difficulty to mine) is dependant on how many miners are trying to get the one block reward. That means if your costs 20K to mine a BTC that's worth 30K today, the next halving your costs will be 20K to receive 15K of BTC, and you would be forced to stop mining or find a cheaper alternative. If the price of BTC doubles than you are safe but (despite what btc maxis think) it can't double forever. It's a non-issue because it will solve itself. Ideally the costs from people buying blockspace (crypto fees) will be drastic enough to make up for today's prehalving inflation rate, which means a ton of POW being done to earn fees - but if today miners are already making the pivot to clean energy (and not by choice) I can't imagine in ~20 years it being any easier to use coal or otherwise.

The energy argument is a global one, picking just crypto is disingenuous because most people are completely ignorant about crypto so this is what they're taught. BTC is a legitimate currency in multiple Countries, crypto is used all over the world in places that don't have banks or face real inflation (Argentina), I spend it on cards in shops with and online too, VISA is using it because it's cheaper/faster than their existing rails, so is Stripe for the same reason. Volitility means you buy at the price you deserve not the price told to you, if housing bounced up and down every 4y and you weren't forced into a $1M two bedroom home maybe you'd be okay with it?

There are real problems with crypto but none of the things you mentioned.

Ethereum has the largest and most active community of developers by a factor of 100, I would estimate. This is a massive advantage for any technology platform. It means there is great documentation, tools, APIs, and resources that make it easy to learn and build with. Got an obscure question about the feature you‚Äôre building? There‚Äôs probably some help guide, Stack Overflow post or YouTube tutorial to answer it.

And that massive developer community also makes it much easier for startups and businesses to hire engineers who already have experience (and for any new skills, again, they can often just Google the answer).

That‚Äôs probably not what you expected to hear. You likely wanted some analysis of TPS or scalability. Ethereum chose the most logical solutions for scalability: a lightweight layer 1 PoS system with sharding and excellent layer 2 options for high transaction throughput. And because they have been focused on that goal longer than any other project, they are by far the most reliable, robust and decentralized smart contract platform available."

Positive,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/uu4clg/bitcoin_instead_of_real_estate/,"Ten years ago, I put my down payment money into Bitcoin instead of real estate. It's up about 1000X. Bitcoin's price continues to grow at a very rapid rate, long term average. You see, there were good reasons for Bitcoin's rapid rise. Most of those reasons still exist. In fact, today there are even more good reasons than there were 10 or 5 years ago. It is reasonable to expect the long term average growth rate of Bitcoin to stay very high for the foreseeable future.

Real estate has significant holding costs (eg: taxes, maintenance, insurance, sometimes fees, interest). Real estate isn't very liquid, and it has extremely high transaction costs.

Ultimately, the price of real estate (and rents) is limited by incomes. For example, in the long run people can't pay more for mort./rent than they earn. Realistically, they might be able to afford 35 or 40 percent of their net income for ""a place to live"". Thus, real estate prices are limited by incomes, in the long run. Incomes tend to barely keep up with inflation.

Looking at long term historical data, such as Case-Shiller, for popular real estate markets, we see, in fact, that real estate prices barely track the rate of inflation, especially when the significant holding costs are properly accounted for.

Bitcoin has no such limit. Bitcoin has no holding costs. Bitcoin is liquid. Bitcoin transactions are typically very little. Bitcoin's price has been more than doubling every year, long term average, and as mentioned before, can reasonably be expected to continues its rapid ascent.

Real estate is currently in a bubble, as evidenced by the price-to-income ratios. The current bubble will pop, as the prior bubble eventually had to pop.

Real estate is nailed down. Bitcoin can be taken with you to anywhere in the world. Real estate is a sitting duck for higher taxes. Real estate can be confiscated.

When the private keys are properly stored, Bitcoin cannot be confiscated.

Knowing all this, a person would be a total idiot to purchase real estate instead of investing in Bitcoin.

Having said that, I do plan on eventually using a small fraction (about 10 or 15 percent) of my Bitcoin holdings to buy my dream home - and to pay for it with Bitcoin, but still end up sitting on a serious stack of sats.

I have zero regrets for investing in Bitcoin instead of real estate, and I never will."
